Media coverage of the issue of abortion access in immigration detention first began in 2017, when the American Civil Liberties Union sued the Trump administration to force them to allow unaccompanied immigrant minors in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement to access abortion. The media reported on events in the court case ([here](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/us/undocumented-immigrant-abortion.html) is an example of such an article), and some articles also went deeper into the issue, looking into exactly what was being done to pregnant minors in ORR custody (like [this one](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/11/internal-emails-reveal-how-the-trump-administration-blocks-abortions-for-migrant-teens/), which looks at internal ORR emails obtained by the ACLU as part of the lawsuit).

After the ACLU reached a settlement with the government where detained minors would be allowed to access abortion, coverage of the issue largely dropped off, but it picked back up again when Roe v. Wade was overturned, as immigrants held in detention centers aren’t free to travel to other states to access abortion the way other people in states that have banned abortion are. This Buzzfeed [article](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/adolfoflores/immigrant-minor-us-custody-abortion-restrictions), for instance, discusses how the fall of Roe v. Wade impacts abortion access for immigrant minors held by ORR. There are also articles like [this one](https://www.axios.com/2022/07/12/abortion-access-detained-migrants-ice) that report on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement Memo saying that detained immigrants seeking abortions will be moved to states where abortion is still legal.

What is missing in the reporting on this issue is a data journalism piece that analyzes the number of detained immigrants that will be affected by Roe v. Wade being overturned. How many immigrants are detained in states that have banned or largely restricted abortion, compared to states where it remains mostly legal? Data on the number of immigrants held by ICE in each state can be obtained from Syracuse University’s [Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse](https://trac.syr.edu/immigration/detentionstats/facilities.html), and data on the number of ORR shelters in each state as of 2020 can be found in a Government Accountability Office [report](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-20-609). The New York Times maintains a regularly updated [database](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/us/abortion-laws-roe-v-wade.html) of abortion laws in each state (we would be able to independently verify this data by looking up each state’s abortion laws, but this provides a good starting point).
