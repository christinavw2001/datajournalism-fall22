# Data Journalism Critique:
- [Use of physical restraints by teachers in Iowa](https://www.acludc.org/en/cases/jd-v-azar-formerly-garza-v-azar-and-garza-v-hargan-challenging-trump-administrations-refusal)
## Clarity and Accuracy:
- From the headline alone, I was able to quickly deduce the main idea of the article, which is that two Iowa school districts are refusing to release information about their use of seclusion. The first couple paragraphs of the article make clear why this issue is timely - data from the first month of the school year shows the use of seclusion on elementary school students in one of the school districts has greatly increased, but the school district refuses to release reports of the circumstances under which seclusion was used, making it almost impossible to find out the reason for the increase. Although the main idea of the article was immediately clear, the first paragraph was a bit cluttered with numbers, making it somewhat difficult to read, which reduced the clarity slightly. 
  - Score: 4/5
- This article did not include data visualization.
- There is room to question the data’s accuracy simply because the author did not explain where she got the data for how many times seclusion had been used in the Cedar Rapids Community School District in the first month of the school year. Since the article opens with this statistic, this immediately raises questions about the accuracy of the article. However, the math in the article is accurate, and other sources of data, such as news reports and information provided by school districts, are cited. If the author had taken the time to simply mention that small piece of information, it would have made the article seem much more credible.
  - Score: 3/5

## Quality: 
- I feel this article was executed at a fair degree of quality. The missing source at the beginning decreases its credibility a bit, and there are parts where there are too many numbers in one paragraph, which can make it difficult to read. However, I think the article does a lot of stuff well. It uses data to highlight the importance of the issue (such as by showing how there has been an unexplained rise in the use of seclusion on elementary school students in one of the school districts). It also explains both sides of the issue. The author explains how seclusion can be traumatizing for students and is sometimes used for minor infractions, but she also details the challenges teachers face in maintaining order and safety in the classroom and includes a mention of how class sizes may be the real issue. Finally, I like how the article balances statistics and data with illustrative stories of specific situations. 
  - Score 4/5

## Type and color (if piece includes graphics)
- This piece does not include graphics

## Creativity
- This piece shows excellent creativity by balancing data and statistics with details and stories to highlight specific points, such as the trauma students face from seclusion and how teachers can struggle to manage classrooms. The stories of students suffering in seclusion are particularly, as the article itself puts it, “heart-rending.” 
  - Score: 5/5
 
# Data Article Pitch:
I’d like to look into how the fall of Roe v. Wade impacts abortion access for people held in immigration detention. Such individuals face added barriers to accessing abortion, as their access is limited by both the policies of the federal government and the laws of the state they are being held in. This story is important to look into as an increasing number of states ban or restrict abortion, especially since many female migrants are sexually assaulted on the way to the U.S. The data portion of this story would involve looking at and creating a visualization showing the number of migrants held in states that have banned or greatly restricted abortion. Up-to-date [information](https://trac.syr.edu/immigration/detentionstats/facilities.html) on the number of migrants held by ICE in each state in maintained by Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, but I was unable to find similar information for the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is responsible for housing undocumented minors that enter the country without parents or guardians. I might have to file a FOIA request to get this information, or I might have to rely on another dataset that could also give me a sense how many unaccompanied minors are held in each state, such as the number of ORR shelters in each state (data from 2020 on this are included in a Government Accountability Office [report](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-20-609)). For this story, I would interview a representative of ORR to get clarity on what their policy is regarding abortion-seeking migrants in states that have banned abortion (according to the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ice-says-immigrant-women-in-custody-still-entitled-to-abortion-services-11657639375?mod=panda_wsj_author_alert), ICE has issued a memo guaranteeing abortion access for its detainees and stating that if necessary they will transfer a detainee to another state so they can access abortion), a representative of an abortion rights group (possibly the ACLU, which has previously [advocated](https://www.acludc.org/en/cases/jd-v-azar-formerly-garza-v-azar-and-garza-v-hargan-challenging-trump-administrations-refusal) for abortion access for detained migrants) and if possible lawyers/advocates working on the ground to help detainees access abortion.
