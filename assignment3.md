## Possible data issues
It is quite difficult to find exact data on the number of immigrants detained in each state. One problem we may run into is only being able to find data that is too coarse. For instance, we want the number of minors in ORR custody in each state, but we were only able to find a [GAO report](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-20-609) that only has the number of ORR shelters in each state. There is no way of knowing from this dataset how many minors are in each shelter. Unless we are able to request this data from ORR, we will have to make do with what we have and make assumptions about the relative number of minors held in each state based on the number of shelters in each state. 

One problem with the [TRAC data on the number of ICE detainees in each state](https://trac.syr.edu/immigration/detentionstats/facilities.html) is that some of the current guaranteed minimums are missing. The average daily population is probably a more useful value for our purposes, but if we want to use the current guaranteed minimum we will need to contact TRAC and clarify if those blank spots mean there is no current guaranteed minimum for those facilities or if they just mean TRAC wasnâ€™t able to get the data for those facilities.

Another problem with this data is that it is unclear exactly how TRAC obtained it, which is also something we will want to ask them about so we can ensure it is accurate.

The TRAC data are also too granular: the data are broken down to the number of immigrants held in each facility, but we want the number of immigrants held in each state. We will have to add up the numbers for each facility in each state.

Finally, a problem with the GAO data, the TRAC data and the [data from the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/us/abortion-laws-roe-v-wade.html) is that the data are not in an easily accessible format. We will have to copy down the data we need and make our own spreadsheet.
